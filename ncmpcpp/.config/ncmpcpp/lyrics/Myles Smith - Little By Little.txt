Time, wish we could go back in time
Wish that our stars were aligned
Wish that we could start again
I wish that we'd spoken our minds
Shared all the parts that we hide
Wish that we could start again

How do we get here? Where do we stand?
You used to love me for all that I am
Have we just wasted all of our youth?
All of our dreams that never came true

We were just kids who fell in love
We didn't know quite what it was
Sad how we've grown so far apart
Everything's fading out

Little by little
Little by little
Little by little
Everything's fading out
It's fading out

We used to laugh, used to smile, used to dream
Oh, how I miss that version of me
Won't you take me back again?

How do we get here? Where do we stand?
You used to love me for all that I am
Have we just wasted all of our youth?
All of our dreams that never came true

We were just kids who fell in love
We didn't know quite what it was
Sad how we've grown so far apart
Everything's fading out

Little by little
Little by little
Little by little
Everything's fading out

We were just kids who fell in love
We didn't know quite what it was
Sad how we've grown so far apart
Everything's fading out
It's fading out
