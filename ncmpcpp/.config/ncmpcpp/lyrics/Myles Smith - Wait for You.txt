I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait for you

Oh, friend of mine
See you walking down the road
But you don't have to walk alone
No need to hide
I know it's hard to let it go
It's even harder if you don't

Oh, ah oh
It gets better when you reach the other side
Oh, ah oh
It's hard to see it but I promise there's a light

I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Don't be afraid, you can push me away
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
'Til the light in your eyes
Reappears, I'll be here by your side
I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait
I will wait for you

Lost in the tide
Tried to swim against the waves
Don't let your hope be pulled away
I know what it's like
I've seen dark and lonely days
I know you'll make it out okay

Oh, ah oh
It gets better when you reach the other side
Oh, ah oh
It's hard to see it but I promise there's a light

I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Don't be afraid, you can push me away
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
'Til the light in your eyes
Reappears, I'll be here by your side
I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait

Don't let the words in your head ever drown you out
Don't let the weight of the world ever bring you down
Keep fighting your demons, I know you can make it out
I hope that one day you can see how I see you now

I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
Don't be afraid, you can push me away
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
'Til the light in your eyes
Reappears, I'll be here by your side
I see you fighting those demons inside
I will wait for you, I will wait
I will wait for you
